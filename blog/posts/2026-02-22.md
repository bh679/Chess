# From Zero to Live Multiplayer in a Week

This is the first entry in the chess project dev log. Rather than easing in, the opening week delivered something absurd: 20+ merged pull requests, live multiplayer, a complete frontend redesign, Stockfish analysis tools, and a fully automated AI development pipeline. Let's break it down.

## Completed This Week

**Live Multiplayer** was the headline feature. The chess-api got a full WebSocket server (`ws.js`, `rooms.js`, `matchmaking.js`) handling real-time game rooms, FIFO quick-match queues per time control, and support for an "any" time control that matches players regardless of preference. On the client side, PR #60 wired it all together. A quick follow-up (#65) fixed a join bug where the timer was missing and the opponent was incorrectly shown as a bot. The WebSocket also needed an Apache proxy fix to bind to the `/ws` path — both sides shipped same-day.

**Full Game Analysis** arrived in a cluster of PRs. Board analysis runs Stockfish post-game to classify moves by centipawn loss. Arrow overlays (#50) show engine best moves as SVG arrows during replay. The evaluation bar (#52) displays centipawn / mate scores live. Move strip drag-scroll (#49) makes navigating long games on mobile workable. Live Move Review (#64) extended the analysis pipeline to work in real-time during play.

**Frontend Redesign** (#54) replaced the old layout with a settings bottom sheet, unified the board area, and added multiple piece art styles. A post-game summary screen (#53) now shows accuracy stats and move classifications. The new game menu got a proper wizard (#63) and a dedicated "Friendly" button (#62) for human-vs-human games.

**AI improvements** included selectable engines (#57) with a click-on-name dropdown to switch Stockfish variants, plus a fix (#58) for games where the accuracy formula was producing 0% on loss — a centipawn-loss edge case that slipped through.

**URL Routing** (#56) gave the client proper path-based navigation with an `.htaccess` SPA catch-all on the server side and hash-based routing in the JS.

**Premoves** (#51) — queue a move during your opponent's turn and it fires instantly when your turn comes. A competitive staple, now in.

**Dev automation** landed too: a Blogging Agent (#61) posts weekly updates (meta, I know), an auto-deploy PHP endpoint lets agents push to production with a single curl, and the CI enforces version bumps on every PR.

## Progress

The project board now sits at 41 items: **25 done**, 2 in active development (Roadmap Agent, Dev Agent), 1 ready for testing (User Account System), 1 approved and queued (Update READMEs with Wiki Links).

## Coming Up

**User Account System** is sitting at "Ready for Testing" with a score of 34 — the highest of any incomplete feature. Expect that to land soon. The Roadmap Agent is actively being built and will automate the backlog prioritisation. Live Spectating and a deeper Frontend Redesign are both tracked as Ideas with enough demand to likely move up the queue.
