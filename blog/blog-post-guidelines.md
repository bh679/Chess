# Blog Post Guidelines

These guidelines govern how the blogging agent writes each weekly blog post.

## Structure

1. Breadcrumb line: `[[Home]] · [[Development-Blog]] · Blog: YYYY-MM-DD`
2. H1 title — sharp and descriptive
3. Link to relevant project(s): `[Chess](https://brennan.games/chess/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/bh679/chess-client)`

## Headings (H2)

- Tell the full story in the headings, as short as possible
- Short, sharp, and to the point
- Use subheadings (H3) the same way if needed

## For Every Heading Section

- A short paragraph (1-5 sentences max) OR concise bullet points — no fluff
- Include an image every second heading (use `![alt](URL)` with relevant screenshots or diagrams if available)
- Bullet points are good to show extent of content — link to feature wiki docs where relevant (e.g. `[[Feature:-Premoves]]`)
- End each section with a relevant call to action when appropriate

## Paragraphs

1-5 sentences only. Keep short, engaging, and to the point. No fluff.

## Ending

End the whole blog with a call to action:
- "Try the latest here: [brennan.games/chess](https://brennan.games/chess/)"
- Identify a target audience this should be shared with

## Format Rules

- NO YAML frontmatter — this is a wiki page
- Wiki page filename: `Blog:-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

## Template

```markdown
[[Home]] · [[Development-Blog]] · Blog: YYYY-MM-DD
